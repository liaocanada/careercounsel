## To-do list
As you can see, there's a lot of cool stuff planned ahead! Feel free to make some PRs if you can implement some of these features!

### Most Urgent
- [ ] Let user select job limit, and display estimated loading time
- [ ] Use AWS Comprehend (machine learning) to identify key skills (backend)
- [ ] Find a way to reduce costs, AWS Comprehend would cost approx. $2 per search
- [ ] Display these key skills on the front end
- [ ] Log API searches

### Somewhere on the way
- [ ] Use AWS Comprehend (machine learning) to identify context (e.g. "history of our company" vs "Bachelor's in History)
- [ ] Set up sources of revenue (servers aren't free!)
- [ ] Add automatic CloudFront invalidations to the continuous deployment pipeline 
- [ ] Add associates degree

### Someday
- [ ] Better visualizations - graphs, coloured maps showing salary, etc. 
- [ ] Support more countries than just US and Canada
- [ ] Provide search suggestions for those simply trying out the app
