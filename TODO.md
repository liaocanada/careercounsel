## To-do list
As you can see, there's a lot of cool stuff planned ahead! Feel free to make some PRs if you can implement some of these features!

### Most Urgent
- [ ] Migrate backend to Elastic Beanstalk/EC2 -- reason: API Gateway has an unchangeable 29 second timeout
- [ ] Use AWS Comprehend (machine learning) to identify key skills (backend)
- [ ] Display these key skills on the front end
- [ ] Improve the look of error messages 

### Somewhere on the way
- [ ] Let user select job limit, and display estimated loading time
- [ ] Use AWS Comprehend (machine learning) to identify context (e.g. "history of our company" vs "Bachelor's in History)
- [ ] Set up sources of revenue (servers aren't free!)
- [ ] Add automatic CloudFront invalidations to the continuous deployment pipeline 

### Someday
- [ ] Better visualizations - graphs, coloured maps showing salary, etc. 
- [ ] Support more countries than just US and Canada
- [ ] Provide search suggestions for those simply trying out the app
